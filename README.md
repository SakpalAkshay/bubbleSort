# bubbleSort
Explanation

Imagine you have a bunch of numbered balls that you want to arrange in order from the smallest to the largest.

With bubble sort, you start by comparing the first two balls. If the first ball is bigger than the second one, you swap them. Then, you move one position to the right and compare the second and third balls. Again, if the second ball is bigger than the third one, you swap them.

You keep doing this, moving one position to the right each time, comparing and swapping neighboring balls if they're not in the right order. As you do this, the biggest balls "bubble up" to the end of the line, like bubbles rising in a glass of soda.

You repeat these comparisons and swaps until you go through the entire line of balls without needing to make any swaps. When this happens, you know all the balls are in the right order, with the smallest ones on the left and the biggest ones on the right.

Bubble sort might not be the fastest way to sort the balls, especially if you have a lot of them, but it's a simple method that can get the job done eventually.
